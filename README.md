#File Name
the file name of .vtt can be in Chinese.However,other languages have not been tested yet.If the file tranistion fails,change the file name to use only English and nin-special symbols.  (*^ω^*)
.vtt 的文件名可以是中文,其他的语言还没试过,可能存在转换失败的情况,把文件名改成英文或数字等非特殊符号就可以解决(中文理论上是可以的)

Incidentally,it's my first time to use github,if there are any issues in any part,please forgive me.>_<
The majority of the English description was automatically translated,they might look a bit strange.
